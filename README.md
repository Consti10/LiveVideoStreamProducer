# LiveVideoStreamProducer
This project has been merged into my LiveVideo10ms repository under VideoCore
https://github.com/consti10/livevideo10ms

https://github.com/Consti10/LiveVideo10ms/blob/5c66cdf80ec982d29fdad7092de5310494bca072/VideoCore/src/main/cpp/VideoTransmitter/VideoTransmitter.cpp

You can use the buttons STARTSTREAMINGSERVER to start the stream and configure it using SS_Settings

I strongly recommend using the latest version of the LiveVideo10ms master branch instead of the code here.
